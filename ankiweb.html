This add-on allows to view and edit the current search string in a separate multi-line dialog. This is useful if have long deck or tag names (e.g. with the AnKing decks) or if you use the add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/831846358" rel="nofollow">Browser: Table/Editor side-by-side (horizontal split)</a>.

Check the section with limitations below. Use this at your own risk.

This add-on works with the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1052724801" rel="nofollow">Browser Search Box: Quick Insert Tag, Deck, Notetype</a> so you can quickly insert a deck, tag, or note type. 

<b># Shortcuts</b>
You can customize the shortcut to open the dialog in the add-on settings. The default shortcut is "Ctrl+t,s" (on MacOS it's "Cmd+t,s"). To use this shortcut you press "Ctrl+t" at the same time. Then you release both keys and then press "s".

<b># Limitations</b>
This add-on has several limitations, e.g.:

- Inserting prior searches is <b>not</b> supported at the moment.
- You can <b>not</b> click in or drag and drop from the browser sidebar into this window. Instead use the add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1052724801" rel="nofollow">Browser Search Box: Quick Insert Tag, Deck, Notetype</a>
- The "Filter Button" is <b>not</b> visible in all supported versions for technical reasons. At the moment it's only visible in 2.1.26 or newer.
- The method I use for splitting up long strings into multiple lines when opening the dialog is pretty basic at the moment: I try to keep quoted searches in one line and apart from this I insert a linebreak for every space.
